	<h2 class="h2"> About Us</h2>
	<p>BC Children’s is the only hospital in the province devoted exclusively to the care of children. That means one million kids—including some of the sickest and most seriously injured—count on the hospital for specialized care they often can’t receive anywhere else. Last year, more than 96,000 patients visited the hospital—which not only includes its acute care centre, but also its research institute, mental health facility and rehabilitation centre. <br> <br>

Since 1982, our Foundation has been working to inspire people and communities to join our quest and raise the bar of children’s health care. Your generosity helps change the lives of families today—from enabling new programs that deliver compassionate care tailored to the needs of children, to purchasing the latest innovations in equipment. And your support is changing the lives of families tomorrow—helping shape what child health can become—by fueling research aimed at conquering and ultimately preventing childhood diseases.</p>
